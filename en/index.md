# 🙋‍♂️ About Me
I’m Oscar David Acosta Soto, a software engineer from **Mexico City, Mexico**. I’m a **Back-End developer specialized in .NET**, focused on building solid, maintainable web applications.

I primarily work with C# and **Blazor Server**, but I’m also comfortable using other programming languages such as **JavaScript, Python**, and **TypeScript**. I enjoy solving complex problems, **designing clear architectures**, and **automating processes**, as well as creating practical solutions that other developers can easily integrate into their projects.
